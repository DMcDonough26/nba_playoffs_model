Analysis to identify what leads to making the postseason in the NBA

There is a lot of conventional wisdom about what leads to success in the NBA (defense wins championships, you need to stars, etc.)

This is something I was curious to better understand and decided to do a bit of analysis to look into it further.

I brainstormed a number of variables that would be easy to scrape from basketball reference and wikipedia. This is by no means comprehensive but just a quick investigation of the idea. This information is captured in the first notebook, and for reference I've attached the CSVs as well.

In the analysis, I walk through a standard data science workflow to arrive at what appear to be the most relevant factors: winning the battle of effective field goal percentage - something that was very front and center in the NBA this year with how many games were decided by the team with the higher three point percentage that night.
